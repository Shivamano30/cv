        <h3>Project Management</h3>
        <p>Being a PMP certified professional was my long term plan as I thought it would enhance my profile. I always believe that am capable of influencing Stakeholders through my effective communication. So I made use
          of this COVID lockdown to become a PMP ceritified professional. </p>

        <h3>Scrum Master</h3>
        <p>I came to know that all my friends who were in software companies are following Agile practices since the last few years. So I started learning Scrum framework and found it quite interesting in handling projects with dynamic requirements.
          So I became a Certified Scrum Master and a Product Owner.</p>

        <h3>Devops Expert</h3>
        <p>Recently I realized that its time for me to up-skill myself as a technology professional. The result of my analysis made me land-up in a Devops environment. Devops covers almost all variants of technology from Linux, Java based Web
          Development, Python, SQL, SDLC processes and Cloud. So I targetted on AWS-Devops Engineer certification and obtained it.</p>
